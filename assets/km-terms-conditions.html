issued by a bank acceptable to us. www.mandalacrame.com retains the right to refuse any request made by you. If your <br>

with. This will usually be www.mandalacrame.com or may in some cases be a third party. Where a contract is made with a <br>
third party www.mandalacrame.com is not acting as either agent or principal and the contract is made between yourself <br>
and that third party and will be subject to the terms of sale which they supply you. When placing an order you undertake<br>
that all details you provide to us are true and accurate, that you are an authorized user of the credit or debit card <br>

(a) Our Contract<br>
When you place an order, you will receive an acknowledgement e-mail confirming receipt of your order: this email will <br>
only be an acknowledgement and will not constitute acceptance of your order. A contract between us will not be formed <br>
until we send you confirmation by e-mail that the goods which you ordered have been dispatched to you. Only those goods <br>
listed in the confirmation e-mail sent at the time of dispatch will be included in the contract formed.<br>
                    <br>

Whilst we try and ensure that all details, descriptions and prices which appear on this Website are accurate, errors may<br>
occur. If we discover an error in the price of any goods which you have ordered we will inform you of this as soon as <br>
possible and give you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it. If we are unable to <br>
contact you we will treat the order as cancelled. If you cancel and you have already paid for the goods, you will <br>
receive a full refund.<br>
Delivery costs will be charged in addition; such additional charges are clearly displayed where applicable and included<br>
in the 'Total Cost'.<br>
                    <br>
(c) Payment<br>
Upon receiving your order we carry out a standard authorization check on your payment card to ensure there are <br>
sufficient funds to fulfil the transaction. Your card will be debited upon authorisation being received. The monies <br>
received upon the debiting of your card shall be treated as a deposit against the value of the goods you wish to <br>
purchase. Once the goods have been despatched and you have been sent a confirmation email the monies paid as a deposit <br>
shall be used as consideration for the value of goods you have purchased as listed in the confirmation email.<br>
